# react
Learning [React](https://reactjs.org) and [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)

This is the merge of two other repositories (now deleted), so history can be
out of order until this commit.

## [react-tutorial](./react-tutorial/)
Learning React following [their tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

## [react-native-tutorial](./react-native-tutorial/)
Learning React Native following [their tutorial](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)

Also, made a port of the *react-tutorial* to run on Android devices (should run
on iOS as well).

## [react-native-webview](./react-native-webview/)
Sending data between a *React Native* application and a *React* web page :)
